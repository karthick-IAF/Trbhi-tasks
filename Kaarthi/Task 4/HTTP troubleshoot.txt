Tried to start the IISAdmin service and unable to start the same. 
Checked the file permission of C23 files under C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\Microsoft\Crypto\RSA\MachineKeys directory.
Changed the DefaultAppPool's identity to ApplicationPoolIdentity and started the service DefaultAppPool, the http://localhost/ is started working.
